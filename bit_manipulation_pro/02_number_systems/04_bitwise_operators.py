# What Are Bitwise Operators?
# This lesson provides an in-depth discussion about Bitwise operators.

# This lesson will help you understand Bitwise operators and how to use them by giving practical examples.

# ? Why use Bitwise operators?
# In computer programming, a Bitwise operation operates on one or more bit patterns or binary numerals
# at the bit level.

# Advantages
# - They are fast and simple action.
# - They are directly supported by the processor.
# - They are used to manipulate values for comparisons and calculations.
# - Bitwise operations are incredibly simple and faster than arithmetic operations.
# - Bitwise algorithms are used to perform operations at bit-level or to manipulate bits in different ways.

# Bitwise operations are much faster and are sometimes used to improve the efficiency of a program.

# Remember this
# Any indication of a bitâ€™s position is counted from the right(least significant) side to the left.

# For example
# The binary value 0001 (decimal 1) has zeroes at every position but the first(the rightmost) one.
