# Decimal Number System
# The decimal number system is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers.

# What is the decimal number system?#
# Long ago, humans created a number system that has exactly ten digits.

# This number system is called the Decimal Number System and the digits in this number system are 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.

# If a number system has n digits, we say that the base of the number system is n. So, the decimal
# number system can also be called a base-10 number system.

# Let’s look at place values for decimals in the below picture.

# We write the number in one row and multiple columns. The rightmost column corresponding to the rightmost
# digit is called the one’s place. The second right column is called the tens place, and we go on increasing
# in multiples of tens, e.g., hundreds place, thousands place, and so on.

# Suppose we have to represent this in powers of 10. In that case, the rightmost place
# (or the least significant digit) corresponds to 10^0 and continues 10^1 and so on towards the left side.

# Decimal Number System Example
# Let’s write the number 1256 in the decimal number system.
# int n = 1256;

# Repeatedly do the modulo operation until n becomes 0 using:
# “%” and “division” operations.
