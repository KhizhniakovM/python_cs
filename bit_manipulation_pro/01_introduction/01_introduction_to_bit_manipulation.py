# Introduction to Bit Manipulation
# Thanks for choosing this course! The techniques you learn here will go towards building strong
# algorithmic problem-solving skills.

# Intended audience
# In order to ace coding interviews for tech companies, it is necessary to understand Bitwise
# operators, which are usually fast compared to arithmetic and other math operations.

# - This course is designed for everyone who wants to improve on their bit manipulation skills.
# - It targets all the software aspirants who want to get strong with Mathematical and Analytical
#   thinking in solving Algorithmic problems.
# - This is a critical topic for interviews with FAANG companies.
# - This course helps competitive programmers who participate in CodeChef, Topcoder, CodeForces,
#   HackerRank, HackerEarth, Leetcode, etc.
# - We will go step by step what bitwise operators are and where they are used.

# Prerequisites
# If you understand Bitwise operators, this course will help you re-write your algorithmic solutions
# with bit manipulation solutions.

# If you are new to Bitwise operators, this course is perfect for you. We start simple before moving
# to more complex concepts for bitwise operators. We then learn how to solve coding problems
# using Bitwise operators.

# Good to have knowledge of:

# Basics of a programming language
# - if-else conditional blocks
# - loops
# - primitive types, their range, Etc.

# Our solutions are written in C++, Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript. We think they are the best languages to use for interviews as they are well-known and very similar to pseudocode.
