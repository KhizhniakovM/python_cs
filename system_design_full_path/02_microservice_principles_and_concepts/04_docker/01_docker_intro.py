# Chapter walkthrough
# This chapter introduces Docker and covers the following:

# After studying the chapter, the reader is able to run the examples provided in the following chapters in a Docker environment.

# Docker and microservices are nearly synonymous. This chapter explains why Docker fits so well with microservices.

# Docker facilitates software installation. Important for this is the Dockerfile, which describes the installation of the software in a simple way.

# Docker Machine and Docker Compose support Docker on server systems and complex software environments with Docker.

# The chapter lays the foundation for an understanding of technologies such as Kubernetes Cloud Foundry, which are based on Docker.

# Licences and projects
# Docker is under the Apache 2.0 license. It is developed by the company Docker, Inc., among others.

# Some core components, such as Moby, for example, are under an Open Source license and allow other developers to implement systems similar to Docker.

# Docker is based on Linux containers, which isolate processes in Linux systems from each other. The Open Container Initiative ensures via standardization of the compatibility of the different container systems.
