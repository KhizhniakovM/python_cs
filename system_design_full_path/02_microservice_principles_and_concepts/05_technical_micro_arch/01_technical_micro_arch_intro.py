# Introduction
# In this lesson, we'll get a walkthrough of what this chapter holds for us.

# Why are microservices so important?
# One of the strengths of microservices is that different technologies can be used in each individual microservice.

# The technologies in the microservices can be defined as part of the microarchitecture(see chapter 3).

# However, there are technical challenges to consider when selecting technologies for microservices.

# Chapter walkthrough
# This chapter explains how to deal with the technical microarchitecture:

# The reader gets to know the requirements regarding, e.g., operation or resilience, which the microarchitecture has to fulfill.

# Often microservices are implemented with reactive technologies. Thus, the chapter discusses this option in more detail and explains when this approach makes sense.

# As a concrete example of technical microarchitecture, the chapter shows Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

# Based on Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, the chapter shows how the technical requirements the microarchitecture has to address can be fulfilled.

# In addition, the chapter shows how the programming language Go in conjunction with appropriate frameworks fulfills the requirements for implementing microservices.
