# Responsive Interfaces
# In this lesson, we will talk about responsive user interfaces.

# In the previous lesson, I discussed mobile-friendly responsive websites. These websites run in the mobile browser and is one way of having a mobile client for our service. In this lesson, we will have a quick insight into developing responsive websites for our service.

# There are two approaches to designing responsive websites: mobile-first and web-first. We already know what these terms mean. In the mobile-first approach, we design the website for the small screen and then let it adapt to the bigger desktop screen.

# In the second approach, we do the opposite. We design the website for the bigger screen and then let it adapt to the smaller screens.

# In this day and age, when most of the world is online, there are a plethora of smart devices available in the market with different and unique screen sizes, including smart TVs, smartwatches, Kindle, Android-powered devices, IoT devices, Blackberry, Windows handheld phones, Apple products like iPhone, iPad and the list doesn’t end here.

# We can now even check our Facebook notifications and emails on our super tiny smartwatch screens. Well, if you ask me, I will always prefer to check my messages on my phone, unless I am James Bond.

# Anyway, it’s not possible for developers to create and maintain dedicated user interfaces for every screen size. This makes writing a responsive user interface an obvious go-forward approach for us.

# A popular saying with responsive web design is that the content should be like water. It should take the shape of the vessel it is poured into.

# Okay!! Now, let’s talk about the popular technologies used by the developers for writing responsive user interfaces.

# Designing responsive websites
# I am not a designer, how do I develop a responsive website?

# If you are not a designer, you are more of a backend developer and even cannot hire a designer and want to design a professional-looking responsive website all by yourself. Pick BootstrapJS. Period.

# BootstrapJS is a production-grade open-source CSS framework for designing responsive user interfaces. It contains CSS, standard JavaScript features, animations, typography, form elements, buttons, and many more commonly used website elements. Everything is pre-loaded, so we don’t have to write anything from the ground up. Create a grid, plug the elements together and build your website.

# Also, since the framework is open source, there are a lot of ready-made templates and plugins, both free and premium, if you need much more than what the core framework offers. Still, if you cannot find the additional features online, you can always write it for yourself as the code is open to all.

# I have personally used the Bootstrap framework for most of my websites. It has never let me down. I am not a designer. I am more of a full-stack developer. The learning curve is not that steep. If you have some idea of frontend development, it should hardly take less than a week to get the hang of the framework. It’s intuitive and easy to understand. Just wisely use the grid-based approach using rows and columns to build the web page.

# The framework was originally written at Twitter to have consistency across all the user interfaces of the internal tools. Before Bootstrap, the Twitter frontend developers struggled with the maintenance and consistency across multiple user interfaces. At a later point, Twitter released the project as open source. You can check out some of the projects built using the Bootstrap framework here.

# Another popular framework for writing responsive websites was jQuery Mobile. The project is developed and maintained by the jQuery project team. Though, JQuery is taking a nose-dive in popularity since most of its features are now offered by modern browsers with vanilla JavaScript without the need to write much code.

# Also, I am biased towards using Bootstrap because I really like the default CSS provided by the framework.

# Besides these two popular frameworks, if you wish to browse through some other solutions for designing responsive websites, many include Skeleton, HTML5 Boilerplate, Less Framework, etc.

# So, Folks! That’s about it regarding designing responsive websites. In the next lesson, let’s talk about the types of mobile apps.
