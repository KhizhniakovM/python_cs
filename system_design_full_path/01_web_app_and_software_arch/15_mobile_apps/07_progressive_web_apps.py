# Progressive Web Apps
# In this lesson, we will understand progressive web apps and why we should build them for our service.

# What are progressive web apps?
# Progressive web apps or PWAs are apps having the look and feel of native apps that can run in both mobile and desktop browsers. They can be installed on the user’s device right from the browser as opposed to the app stores. When installed on the device, progressive web apps run in their own window without an address bar or a browser tab, just like native apps. When we open a PWA in the browser tab, we see the install option with a plus sign in the address bar. Clicking on it will install the app on our device with a shortcut on the home screen.

# But don’t we already have responsive mobile websites for the browsers? Why do we need progressive web apps? What good is that?

# The need for PWAs
# Today, businesses are more inclined towards writing progressive web apps than responsive websites as they have the same look and feel as native apps. The general flow is that the businesses entertain the search engine traffic via their responsive mobile websites and then try to re-direct that traffic to their native mobile apps. I’ve talked about this before.

# Now, instead of directing the users to their native apps, businesses can offer the same native app experience to the users directly in their browsers. Also, if the user wishes, they can install the app from the browser on their device. Progressive web apps function just like the native apps with having access to the underlying OS and the device hardware.

# Also, since progressive web apps are developed using open web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, also with the help of frameworks like Angular, React, Ionic, and Google Polymer, there is no native tech learning curve. Just write the code once, and run it everywhere.

# PWAs run in both mobile and desktop browsers and can even be installed on desktops. These apps can work offline and have push notifications just like native apps. Search engines can index them and users can share the links of the apps with their friends. We don’t need to update them every now and then as we generally do with native apps.

# So, every time we open an installed PWA on our device, we will see the latest version of it, just like the regular websites on the web.

# So, that means there is a possibility of native apps going obsolete. Right?

# Will PWAs replace native apps?
# No!! PWAs are not a replacement for native apps. Native apps still hold good for the use cases I discussed in the previous lesson. We definitely don’t want to write an online mobile game that is CPU intensive with a PWA. A Native app will easily beat a PWA in terms of performance and user experience.

# PWAs are more in competition with responsive mobile websites. I mean, why write a responsive website when you can develop something that provides an app-like experience? Imagine browsing an e-commerce website via a responsive mobile site and then with a progressive web app. One would always prefer an app-like experience.

# Now, let’s have a look at some of the examples of progressive web apps.

# Examples of progressive web apps
# BookMyShow PWA
# Bookmyshow.com is India’s leading event and movie online ticket-booking platform with over 75 million monthly visitors. They experienced a high bounce rate on their mobile website and to bring it down they replaced it with a progressive web app.

# After the launch of their PWA, they observed an exponential increase, upto 80 % on the conversion rates. In terms of the app size, their PWA is 54 times lighter than their Android app and 180 times than their iOS app.

# Flipkart PWA
# Flipkart.com. India’s leading retail e-commerce website, shut down its mobile website and moved forward with the app-only strategy. It was hard for the development team to provide an app-like immersive experience on their responsive mobile website.

# With the launch of their progressive web app, the engagement rate increased three times, the conversion rate went up by 70 %, and there was a reduction in the data usage by three times. For a full account, here you go.

# Twitter PWA
# Twitter gets approx. 7 billion monthly visits. It launched its progressive web app in 2017 and made it the default mobile web experience for users. This increased their pages per session by 65 %, decreased the bounce rate by 20%, and increased the tweets sent by 75%.

# In the next lesson, let’s understand mobile backend as a service.
