# Client
# In this lesson, we will explore the client component of the client-server architecture.

# Client
# The client holds our user interface. The user interface is the presentation part of the application. Itâ€™s written in HTML, JavaScript, CSS and is responsible for the look and feel of the application.

# The user interface runs on the client. In very simple terms, a client is a gateway to our application. It can be a mobile app, a desktop or a tablet like an iPad. It can also be a web-based console, running commands to interact with the backend server.

# Technologies used to implement clients in web applications
# The open-source technologies popular for writing the web-based user interface in the industry are vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc. All these libraries are written in JavaScript.

# There are a plethora of other technologies that can be leveraged as well for writing the front-end. I brought up the popular ones for now.

# Different platforms require different frameworks and libraries to write the front-end of our application. For instance, mobile phones running Android need a different set of tools than those running Apple or Windows OS.

# If you are intrigued about understanding the technologies popular in the industry, do take a look at the latest developer survey run by StackOverflow.
