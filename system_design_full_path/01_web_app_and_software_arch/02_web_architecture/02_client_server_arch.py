# Client-Server Architecture
# This lesson provides an introduction to a client-server architecture.

# You already learned a bit about the client-server architecture when we discussed the two-tier, three-tier and n-tier architecture. Now, we look at it in detail.

# Client-server architecture is the fundamental building block of the web.

# The architecture works on a request-response model. The client sends the request to the server for information and the server responds with it.

# Every website you browse, be it a WordPress blog, an application like Facebook, Twitter, or your banking app, is built on the client-server architecture.

# A very small percentage of business websites and applications use the peer-to-peer architecture, which differs from the client-server.

# I will discuss that later in the course. For now, letâ€™s focus on the client.
