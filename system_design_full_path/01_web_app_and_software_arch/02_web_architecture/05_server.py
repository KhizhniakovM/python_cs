# Server
# In this lesson, we will explore the server component of the client-server architecture.

# What is a web server?
# The primary task of a web server is to receive the requests from the client and provide the response after executing the business logic based on the request parameters received from the client.

# Every online service needs a server to run. Servers running web applications are commonly known as application servers.

# Besides the application servers, there are also other kinds of servers with specific tasks assigned. These include:

# - Proxy server
# - Mail server
# - File server
# - Virtual server
# - Data storage server
# - Batch job server and so on

# The server configuration and the type can differ depending on the use case. For instance, if we run a backend application code written in Java, we would pick Apache Tomcat or Jetty. For simple use cases such as hosting websites, we would pick the Apache HTTP Server.

# In this lesson, we will stick to the application server.

# All the components of a web application need a server to run, be it a database, a message queue, a cache, or any other component. In modern application development, even the user interface is hosted separately on a dedicated server.

# Server-side rendering
# Often the developers use a server to render the user interface on the backend and then send the generated data to the client. This technique is known as server-side rendering. I will discuss the pros and cons of client-side vs. server-side rendering further down the course.

# Now we have a fundamental understanding of the client and the server. Letâ€™s delve into the concepts involved in the communication between them.
