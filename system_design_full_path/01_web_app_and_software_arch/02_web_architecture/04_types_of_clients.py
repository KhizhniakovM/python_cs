# Types of Clients
# In this lesson, you will learn about the two types of clients: the thin client and the thick client(sometimes also called the fat client).

# There are primarily two types of clients:

# Thin client
# Thick client(sometimes also called the Fat client)
# Thin client
# A thin client is a client that holds just the user interface of the application. It contains no business logic of any sort. For every action, the client sends a request to the backend server, just like in a three-tier application.

# Thick client
# On the contrary, the thick client holds all or some part of the business logic. These are the two-tier applications. Weâ€™ve already been through them.

# The typical examples of fat clients are utility apps, online games, and so on.
