# chapter. You will learn what a tier is and its components?

# I’ll begin the course by discussing the different tiers involved in the
# software architectural landscape. This is like having a bird’s eye view of
# the software architecture realm and it is important to be understood well.

# This chapter will help us understand:

# What is a tier?
# Why do software applications have different tiers?
# How do I decide how many tiers my application should have?
# What is a tier?#
# Think of a tier as both logical and physical separation of components in an
# application or a service. This separation is at a component level, not the code level.

# What do I mean by components?

# - Database
# - Backend application server
# - User interface
# - Messaging
# - Caching etc.

# These are the components that make up a web service.
