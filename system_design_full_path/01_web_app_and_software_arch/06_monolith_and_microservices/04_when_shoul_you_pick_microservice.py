# When should you pick Microservices Architecture?
# In this lesson, you will learn about the pros and cons of microservice architecture and when to pick it for your project.

# Pros of microservice architecture
# No Single Points of failure
# Since microservices is a loosely coupled architecture, there is no single point of failure. Even if a few services go down, the application as a whole would still be up.

# Leverage the heterogeneous technologies
# Every microservice interacts with each other via a REST API gateway interface. A system with microservices can leverage the polyglot persistence architecture and other heterogeneous technologies like Java, Python, Ruby, NodeJS, etc.

# Polyglot persistence uses multiple database types, like SQL and NoSQL, together in the architecture. We will discuss this in detail in the database lesson.

# Independent and continuous deployments
# The deployments can be independent and continuous. We can have dedicated teams for every microservice, and they can be scaled independently without impacting other services.

# Cons of microservices architecture
# Management complexity
# Microservices is a distributed environment with several services powered by clusters of servers. This makes system management and monitoring complex.

# We need to set up additional components to manage microservices, such as a node manager like Apache Zookeeper, a distributed tracing service for monitoring the nodes, etc.

# We need skilled resources and even have to set up a dedicated team just to manage these services.

# Strong consistency
# Sometimes, strong consistency is hard to guarantee in a distributed environment, especially when trying to achieve a single consistent state across several microservices.

# Things are eventually consistent across the nodes, and this limitation is due to the distributed design.

# In the database chapter, we will discuss both strong and eventual consistency in detail.

# When should you pick a microservices architecture?
# The microservice architecture fits best for complex use cases
# for apps that need to expand quick from adding new features standpoint. A social network application is a good example of a complex use case.

# A typical social networking application has various components such as messaging, real-time chat, LIVE video streaming, photo uploads, post like and share features, etc.

# This use case fits best for a microservices architecture. Also, the microservices architecture enables a business move fast. A business can separately develop, test, deploy an application feature without affecting the current features. There is not much need for regression testing and so on.

# Writing every feature in a single codebase would take no time to become a mess.

# So, by now, we have seen three ways to proceed with the design of our application:

# Picking a monolithic architecture
# Picking a microservice architecture
# Starting with a monolithic architecture and later scaling out into a microservice architecture.
# Picking a monolithic or a microservice architecture largely depends on our use case. I suggest keeping things simple and thoroughly understanding the requirements before deciding on an architecture.

# In the next lesson, letâ€™s understand the trade-offs involved when choosing monolith and microservices architecture.
