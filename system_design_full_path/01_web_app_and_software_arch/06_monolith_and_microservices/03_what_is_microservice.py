# What is Microservice Architecture?
# In this lesson, you will learn about microservice architecture.

# What is microservices architecture?
# In a microservices architecture, different features of an extensive service like Facebook are deployed separately as smaller loosely coupled services called microservices. These microservices work in conjunction to form a large distributed online service as a whole.

# Remember the single responsibility and the separation of concerns principles? Both principles come into effect in a microservices architecture.

# Every service has a single responsibility of running a specific feature and is separated from other services facilitating a loosely coupled architecture.

# This particular architecture facilitates easier, cleaner app maintenance, feature development, testing, and deployment of individual modules in contrast to a monolithic architecture.

# Imagine accommodating every feature in a single repository. How complex would things get? It would be a maintenance nightmare.

# Also, when the project is large, it is managed by several different teams. When application modules/features are separate, they can be assigned to dedicated teams with minimal fuss, smoothing out the development process.

# With microservices, scalability becomes easy too. The architecture is inherently designed to scale. Services that need scaling can be scaled independently without affecting other services.

# Also, every microservice ideally has a separate database. This eliminates single points of failure and system bottlenecks.

# In the next lesson, letâ€™s go through some of the pros and cons of using a microservices architecture.
