# Wide-Column Database
# In this lesson, we will get to know the wide-column database and when to choose it for our projects.

# What is a wide-column database?
# Wide-column databases belong to the NoSQL family of databases and are primarily used to handle massive amounts of data, technically called Big Data.

# Wide-column databases are perfect for analytical use cases. They have a high performance and a scalable architecture.

# Also known as column-oriented databases, wide-column databases store data in a record with a dynamic number of columns. A record can hold billions of columns.

# Popular wide-column databases
# Some of the popular wide-column databases are Cassandra, HBase, Google BigTable, ScyllaDB, etc.

# When To Pick a wide-column database?
# If you have a use case where you need to grapple with Big Data, a wide-column database would fit best.

# Wide-column databases are built to manage Big Data, ensuring scalability, performance, and high availability.

# Real-life implementations
# Some of the real-world implementations of the tech:

# Netflix uses Cassandra in the analytics infrastructure.
# Adobe and other big guns use HBase for processing large amounts of data.
