# Document-Oriented Database
# In this lesson, you will learn about the document-oriented database and when to choose it for our projects.

# What is a document-oriented database?
# Document-oriented databases are the leading types of NoSQL databases. They store data in a document-oriented model in independent documents. The data is generally semi-structured and stored in a JSON-like format.

# The data model is similar to the data model of our application code, so it’s easier to store and query data for developers.

# Document-oriented stores go along well with the Agile software development methodology as it is easier to change things with evolving demands when working with them. Though datastores/technologies and software development methodologies do not have any co-relation per se.

# Popular document-oriented databases
# Some of the popular document-oriented stores used in the industry are MongoDB, CouchDB, OrientDB, Google Cloud Datastore, and Amazon DocumentDB.

# When do I pick a document-oriented data store for my project?
# Pick a document-oriented data store if:

# You are working with semi-structured data and need a flexible schema that will change often.
# You aren’t sure about the database schema when you start writing the app, there is a possibility that things might change over time and you need something flexible that you could change over time with minimum fuss.
# You need to scale fast and stay highly available.
# Typical use cases of document-oriented databases include:

# Real-time feeds
# Live sports apps
# Writing product catalogues
# Inventory management
# Storing user comments
# Web-based multiplayer games
# Being in the family of NoSQL databases, document-oriented databases provide horizontal scalability and performant read-writes because they cater to CRUD(Create Read Update Delete) use cases. These include scenarios where there isn’t much complex relational logic involved and all we need is quick persistence and data retrieval.

# Real-life implementations
# Here are some of the good real-life implementations of the tech:

# SEGA uses Mongo-DB to improve the experience for millions of mobile gamers.

# Coinbase scaled from 15k requests per min to 1.2 million requests per minute with MongoDB
