# Multi-Model Databases
# In this lesson, we will talk about multi-model databases.

# What are multi-model databases?
# Until now, the databases supported only one data model. It could either be a relational, document-oriented, graph, or any other specific data model.

# However, with the advent of multi-model databases, we can leverage different data models by just implementing a single database system.

# Multi-model databases support multiple data models like the graph, document-oriented, relational, etc. They also avert the need for managing multiple persistence technologies in a single service. They reduce the operational complexity by notches. With multi-model databases, we can leverage different data models via a single API.

# Popular multi-model databases
# Some of the popular multi-model databases are ArangoDB, CosmosDB, OrientDB, Couchbase, etc.

# In the upcoming lessons, we will cover the concepts like eventual consistency and strong consistency that are key to understanding distributed systems.
