# Types of Databases
# In this lesson, we will briefly recall the different types of databases.

# Different types of databases
# There are numerous types of databases that are available to the application developers, catering to specific use cases. These are:

# - Document-oriented database
# - Key-value datastore
# - Wide-column database
# - Relational database
# - Graph database
# - Time-series database
# - Databases dedicated to mobile apps and so on.

# In the polyglot persistence lesson, we understood the need for different types of databases. We also covered relational databases in -depth and discussed when to pick a relational one.

# Let’s have insights into the other remaining types of databases and the use cases that fit them. So, without any further ado, let’s get on with it.
