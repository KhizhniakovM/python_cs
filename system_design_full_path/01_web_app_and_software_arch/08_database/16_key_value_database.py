# Key-Value Database
# In this lesson, you will understand the key-value database and when to choose it for your projects.

# What is a key-value database?
# Key-value databases are also a part of the NoSQL family. These databases use a simple key-value pairing method to store and quickly fetch the data with minimum latency.

# Features of a key-value database
# Due to the minimum latency they ensure, that is constant O(1) time, the primary use case for these databases is caching application data.

# The key serves as a unique identifier and has a value associated with it. The value can be as simple as a string and as complex as an object graph.

# The data in key-value databases can be fetched in constant time O(1), and there is no query language required to fetch the data. Itâ€™s just a simple no-brainer fetch operation. This ensures minimum latency.

# As discussed earlier in the course, these databases are also used to achieve a consistent state in distributed systems.

# Popular key-value databases
# Some of the popular key-value data stores used in the industry are Redis, Hazelcast, Riak, Voldemort, and Memcached.

# When do I pick a key-value database?
# If you have a use case where you need to fetch data real fast with minimum fuss, you should pick a key-value datastore.

# Key-value stores are built to serve use cases that require super-fast data fetch.

# Typical use cases of a key-value database are:

# Caching
# Persisting user state
# Persisting user sessions
# Managing real-time data
# Implementing queues
# Creating leaderboards in online games and web apps
# Implementing a pub-sub system
# Real-life implementations
# Here are some of the real-life implementations of the tech:

# Inovonics uses Redis to drive real-time analytics on millions of sensor data.
# Microsoft uses Redis to handle the traffic spike on its platforms
# Google Cloud uses Memcached to implement caching on their cloud platform.
