# Redundancy
# In this lesson, we will explore redundancy as a high availability mechanism.

# Redundancy â€“ Active-passive HA mode
# Redundancy is duplicating the server instances and keeping them on standby to take over in case any of the active server instances go down. It is the fail-safe backup mechanism in the deployment infrastructure.

# The illustration above shows the redundant instances. One of the redundant instances takes over when the active instance goes offline.

# This instance setup approach is also known as the Active-passive HA mode. An initial set of nodes are active, and a set of redundant nodes are passive, on standby. Active nodes get replaced by passive nodes in case of failures.

# There are systems like GPS, aircraft, communication satellites, etc., that have zero downtime. The availability of these systems is ensured by making the components redundant.

# Getting rid of single points of failure
# Distributed systems became mainstream with large-scale applications solely because, in them, we can eliminate the single points of failure that were a big downside of a monolithic architecture. I discussed this in the previous lesson how microservices facilitate a fault-tolerant architecture.

# In a highly available system, a large number of distributed server nodes work in conjunction with each other to achieve a single synchronous application state.

# When so many redundant nodes are deployed, there are no single points of failure in the system. In case a node goes down, redundant nodes take its place. The system as a whole remains unimpacted.

# Single points of failure at the application component level mean bottlenecks. I discussed this earlier, having just one database instance handling requests from a number of application nodes. We should detect bottlenecks in performance testing and get rid of them as soon as possible.

# Monitoring and automation
# Systems should be well monitored in real-time to detect any bottlenecks or single point of failures. Automation enables the instances to self-recover without any human intervention. It gives the instances the power of self-healing.

# Also, the systems become intelligent enough to add or remove instances on the fly as per the requirements. Kubernetes is one good example of this.

# Since the most common cause of failures is human error, automation helps cut down failures considerably.
