# 75. Sort colors. Dutch National Flag Problem (medium)

# * MARK: - Problem statement
# Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place.
# You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

# The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue;
# and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

# * MARK: - Example 1
# Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
# Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]

# * MARK: - Example 2
# Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
# Output: [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]
