# What Is This Course About?
# Here is an overview of what to expect from this course.

# One common challenge senior engineers face is the lack of experience in designing scalable
# systems. The reason because it is not easy to get an opportunity to work on a large project,
# especially from the ground up. Most of the time, software engineers get to work on a small part
# of a bigger system. For these reasons, most engineers feel less prepared for system design interviews,
# as they lack the adequate knowledge required for designing large systems. This course is created to
# help developers learn key system design skills that will help them in interviews and in their
# professional careers.

# One way to improve software designing skills is to understand the architecture of famous systems.
# This is equivalent to learning from others who have worked on designing large systems. In our
# experience, if a developer has a good understanding of the architecture of a complex system,
# it becomes pretty easy for them to gain knowledge from other systems even in a different domain.
# This is true because most system design techniques can easily be adapted and applied to other
# distributed systems.

# One way to learn system design is to read the technical papers of famous systems. Unfortunately,
# reading a paper is generally believed hard, and keeping the system design interview in mind,
# we are not interested in a lot of details mentioned in the papers. This course extracts out
# the most relevant details about the system architecture that the creators had in mind while
# designing the system. Keeping system design interviews in mind, we will focus on the various
# tradeoffs that the original developers had considered and what prompted them to choose a certain
# design given their constraints.

# Furthermore, systems grow over time; thus, original designs are revised, adapted, and enhanced
# to cater to emerging requirements. This means reading original papers is not enough. This course
# will cover criticism on the original design and the architectural changes that followed to overcome
# design limitations and satisfy growing needs.

# What to expect
# The course has two parts: System Design Case Studies and System Design Patterns.

# Part 1: System design case studies
# In the first part, we will go through the architecture of a carefully chosen set of distributed systems:

# Key-value store: Dynamo
# No-SQL wide column stores: Cassandra and BigTable
# Distributed messaging and streaming system: Kafka
# Distributed file storage systems: GFS and HDFS
# Distributed coordination and locking service: Chubby (similar to Zookeeper)

# Part 2: System design patterns
# In the second part of this course, we will describe a set of design problems (and their solutions)
# that are common to distributed systems. We call these techniques ‘System Design Patterns,’ as
# they can be applied to all kinds of distributed systems and are very handy, especially in a
# system design interview. A few examples of such patterns are:

# Write-ahead logging
# Bloom filters
# Heartbeat
# Quorum
# Checksum
# Lease
# Split Brain
