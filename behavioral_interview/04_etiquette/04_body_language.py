# Body Language
# In this lesson, we'll study body language hacks that will help you ace an interview.

# No matter what you say, or how you say it, your body can always give you away. Fortunately, our bodies
# are hackable. Read the list below and practice each action as you read.

# Posture
# Have good posture. This is an automatic signal of assurance and confidence. If you normally have
# bad posture, pretend that a string is pulling you up to the ceiling by the crown of your head.
# This works sitting or standing.

# Eye contact
# Look at the interviewer’s face, not just their eyes. While it is a belief that one should
# look directly into another’s eyes whilst talking, this can be unnerving for both you and the
# interviewer. In order to avoid this, try looking at a different part of the interviewer’s face
# every 2-4 seconds. This will keep you looking engaged and is significantly better than just glaring
# your eyeballs into theirs.

# Hand gestures
# Speak with your hands if you are unsure of what to do with them. It is human nature to hide your
# hands when you’re feeling nervous; however, doing so can communicate to the interviewer that you
# are hiding something. Even though the only thing you are hiding from them is probably your nervousness,
# such behavior can stand out and is best when avoided.

# Think about the last time you watched the news, were the newscaster’s hands under the desk or clasped
# up on the desk? Most likely, their hands were above the desk because, on a biological level, it is much
# easier to trust someone you do not know if you can see that they’re not hiding something.

# So, if you find yourself hiding your hands, use hand gestures as you talk – it will make it easier for
# the interviewer to trust you. On the other hand, if you have been told that you move your hands too
# much when you are talking, try clasping them together in front of you.


# Walk
# Work on your walk. When walking to meet an interviewer make sure that you’re walking directly toward
# them with every body part facing in their direction. Such body position shows you to be confident and
# ready to face challenges head on.


# Body Language Techniques
# In this lesson, we'll study a few other body language techniques.

# Open body language
# Open your body up. Humans have a tendency to cross their arms and/or legs when they are feeling
# nervous or need protection. Go ahead and cross your arms and/or your legs. Do you feel shielded
# and safe? If you do, that’s great, but you do not want the interviewer to feel as if they are on
# the other side of a shield.

# As soon as you sit down for an interview, automatically take a mental note of where your arms and
# legs are. Uncross your arms and legs if they’re crossed. If being so “unprotected” freaks you out,
# it is perfectly fine to cross your ankles as this will give you a feeling of protection without
# cutting the interviewer out.


# Leaning in
# Lean-in to the conversation. Humans naturally “lean-in” to conversations that they are invested in.
# Next time you go to a restaurant, look at the body language of couples, those who seem to be having
# the best time will be leaning close to one another, while those who seem to be disconnected will be
# sitting back. So, try “leaning” into the interview and see what happens.


# Mirroring
# Mirror your interviewer. Mirroring is a natural thing that humans do when they are “vibing” with
# one another. Although it is not advised to start mirroring as soon as the interview starts, it is
# a good thing to do once a rapport has been established as it reinforces your human connection.

# What does this mean? It means that if the interviewer crosses their arms, you cross yours. If they
# cross their legs, you cross your legs too. However, it is important that you do not mimic the
# interviewer’s movement too quickly afterward; you do not want them to think that you are copying them.

# That’s it on body language! In the next lesson, we’ll look at some techniques for video conference interviews.
