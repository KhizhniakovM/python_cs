# Video Conference Interviews
# In this lesson, we'll start learning about video conference interviews.

# Introduction
# Now that you’ve mastered how to act in an in-person interview, it’s time to forget everything
# and learn how to act in a video conference interview. Well, no, not everything, not even close;
# but you do need to commit a few more things to memory before embarking on one of these interviews.

# The most important thing to remember in such an interview is that you need to be visible and audible –
# the interviewer needs to leave the video conference with a strong impression of what you look like
# and sound like in real life. You DO NOT want to be known as the washed-out person with a crackly
# voice. In this course, you will have opportunities to practice on video. While reviewing your
# responses, view at least once with the sound off to assess your body language. The six guidelines
# below will be helpful when embarking on a video conference interview.

# Camera angle
# Be wary of an unflattering camera angle. Unlike person-to-person interviews, your camera may not
# show you as you really are. Before getting on a call, check how your camera is looking at you. One of
# the easiest ways to do this is to pull up the video-calling app (most have picture previews) and adjust
# the camera pre-interview.

# While adjusting, be wary of camera angles that are so low that they give the interviewer a look into
# your nose ​or camera angles that are so high that the interviewer is looking down on you. The correct
# placement for a camera should be right at eye level; however, you must remember to look directly at
# the camera. If you are looking at the computer screen, it will appear as if you are looking down,
# which is not a good look.

# Pro Tip: Grab some big books and rest your laptop on them in front of you. This will bring the camera
# to eye-level.


# Lighting
# Make sure you’re visible. As anyone who has tried to take a selfie knows, getting lighting right can be tricky.

# The biggest problem most people have with lighting in video conferences is the “too much light
# in the background” issue. Too much light can make someone look washed out and hard to look at.
# To fix this problem, try reducing the amount of light behind you; if that makes things too dark,
# find a lamp with an adjustable neck that you can place nearby to cast light on your face. If this
# light is too bright, adjust it.


# Clean background
# Clean your area. One of the biggest differences between an in-person interview and a video conference
# interview is that you control your surroundings. For the most part, this is a positive but, depending
# on the background you choose, it can also be a negative.

# To avoid any awkward moments, make sure that your background is clean. The easiest way to make sure an
# interviewer will not be greeted with any surprises is to find a solid-colored​ wall to sit in front of;
# nothing ruins an otherwise good interview like your half-naked roommate sitting in the living room behind
# you. Do what you can to minimize anything distracting that might occur in the view.

# Techniques for Video Conference Interviews
# In this lesson, we'll look at some more techniques for video conference interviews.

# Simplify your look
# In-person, patterned clothing can be a great way to individualize yourself but, on camera, patterns
# can be distracting and (potentially) blinding. Therefore, it is best to be outfitted in a solid
# colored shirt with minimal jewelry. Remember, this interview is about your skills, not your style;
# there’s no benefit to distracting your interviewer.

# Pro Tip: Blue is the best color to wear on camera.


# Be presentable
# This rule is arguably the most important one in this list – you do not want to be caught on
# camera unawares. Luckily, most cameras have a preview functionality so you should easily be able
# to see if you are on camera. However, if you are worried, just put a sticky note over your computer’s
# camera until you’re ready. After all, you can never be too prepared!


# Clarify your audio
# Last, but not least, is your audio quality. Your interviewer needs to hear what you’re saying or else
# what is the point? If you are unsure of the quality of your audio, call a friend and talk to them,
# see what they think. If you recognize that you have bad audio an easy fix is to get a headset,
# which will clarify your voice and diminish any outside noise.

# Additionally, try and drink a glass of water before you start; making sure that you’re hydrated
# will keep your voice smooth and decrease your chances of having to get up to get water in the
# middle of the interview.

# Remember: Speak slower over devices than you would in person. Digital devices sometimes have a lag.
# Anytime there is something between you and another person, compensate by speaking slower.
