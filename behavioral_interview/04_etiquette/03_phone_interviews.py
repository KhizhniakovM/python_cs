# Phone interviews
# In this lesson, we'll introduce some types of phone interviews.

# Now, let’s go over some techniques that will help you ace your phone interviews, in-person
# interviews, and video-conference interviews.

# For most organizations, phone interviews are required before you even get a chance to sit
# across from an interviewer.

# According to Jorg Stegemann (a headhunter with Kennedy Executive Search & Outplacement in Paris),
# “In a typical search assignment with 100 or more candidates, I identify the 15 that interest me
# most and call them. Based on my impressions during telephone screening interviews, I meet with
# five or seven of these people. Only three of them make the shortlist that I present to my client.”

# So, yeah, phone interviews are pretty important, but don’t be scared; we’ve got you.

# For starters, there are two types of phone interviews: scheduled and unscheduled.

# * MARK: - Scheduled phone interviews
# Scheduled phone interviews are (obviously) scheduled on either LinkedIn or by email. If you
# are responding to a request to schedule make sure that the time you are agreeing to actually
# works for you! It is very important that you are not caught off guard by an appointment you
# accidentally made at an inconvenient time; remember, this interview will most likely determine
# whether or not the organization wants to move ahead with you.

# * MARK: - Unscheduled phone interviews
# The second type of phone interview is unscheduled and they are… unscheduled. However, this
# does not mean that you have to do the interview when they call. If it’s a bad time, tell them
# so by saying something like, “Great to hear from you. I am not at my desk and won’t be able to
# give this call the attention it deserves. When can I call you back?” (Stegemann). Do not feel
# uncomfortable saying this, it shows a commitment to professionalism​.

# Pro Tip: No matter what happens during a phone interview, you must always remain calm and courteous.
# Even if you are not interested in a particular job, a snide remark could hurt your chances there
# and elsewhere. Remember, you do not live in a vacuum, people talk!

# Techniques for phone interviews
# In this lesson, we'll look at three steps to a successful phone interview.

# Study up
# Just like any other interview, it is important to know as much as you can about the organization
# that is interviewing you.

# According to Jorg Stegemann, you should expect to be asked what you know about the organization;
# “if you are not able to state the organization’s key figures, strategy, and markets, the interview
# might be over after only three minutes.” (Stegemann).

# This is no reason to panic! Remember, the interviewer cannot see you, so feel free to employ a cheat
# sheet or search engine to help you answer.

# Be comfortable
# Interviews are stressful enough on their own so be sure to make yourself as comfortable as possible
# to decrease any additional stress. Since the interview is over the phone, you will have more of an
# ability to control your surroundings than you would in even a video conference interview. So, please,
# take advantage of that!

# Listen and then talk

# While on the call, make sure that you listen to the interviewer first and then, and only then, talk.
# In most cases, the interviewer will set the stage and go over some background information. Make sure
# that you are taking notes on these points, you will want to respond to them later.

# In any interview, it is extremely important to find commonalities between you and the interviewer
# and the organization-- make a human connection, you will be more successful if you do. Once they
# are finished talking, it is your time to shine.


# In order to capitalize on the time you have to talk, make sure that:

# - You are hydrated to avoid throat clearing.
# - You have good posture. Posture affects your voice, believe it or not.
# - You are smiling which also affects your voice. Don’t believe us? Record yourself and compare.
# - You end on a good note. For example, “Thanks for the call. I like what I heard and from this
#   information, I am confident I could fill the role. I am very interested in this job and would be pleased
#   to meet you in person. What is the next step?” (Stegemann).


# Following up
# Once the phone interview is done, make sure that you follow up with a thank-you note after
# half a business day. This note should be short and restate your interest, your confidence that
# you can do the job, and a question about next steps. If you do not get a response after a week,
# send another. If you still don’t get a response, send a third note in three week’s time. If there’s
# still no response, move on-- you weren’t a good fit.

# Pro Tip: If you are given the opportunity to choose a time slot for the interviewer to call you…take it!
# Choose a time in the morning if you can; interviewers are human too, and humans tend to get tired as
# the day goes on, so make sure that you talk to them while they’re fresh!
