# Operating Systems
# Learn why the operating system is an essential part of computers.

# What is an OS?
# Most modern computers require an operating system (OS), which manages computer processes, to work.
# Before we launch a new application, we usually check its system requirements. These requirements specify
# the hardware and OS that we need to launch the application.


# Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems
# The system requirements tell us that the OS is a software platform, and the application requires it to
# work correctly. But where did this requirement come from? Why can’t we just buy a computer and launch an
# application without an OS?

# Let’s consider these questions. Modern operating systems are multipurpose, so they offer users many features.
# An OS provides users with the tools to interact with computer hardware. We can’t do too much or use much
# computational power without them. So, an OS is required for any complex computations.

# What is the downside of an OS? We may not use all of these features. However, we cannot disable them.
# The OS utilizes the computer’s resources intensively to maintain all of its features. As a result, we have
# much fewer computation resources for our applications. This overhead sometimes leads to a computer’s sluggish
# performance, with programs hanging, or even the whole system rebooting.

# To answer the question of why we need an OS, we’ll first examine the history of computers in the next lesson.
