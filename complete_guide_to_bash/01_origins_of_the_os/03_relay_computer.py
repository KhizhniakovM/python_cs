# Relay Computers
# Learn what the Z3 computer is, and how it differs from the computers with cylinders.

# * MARK: - Z3 computers
# Tabulators used rotating cylinders to perform calculations. The next generation of computers replaced
# the cylinders with relays. A relay is a mechanical element that changes its state due to an electric current.

# The German engineer Konrad Zuse designed one of the first relay computers–Z2–in 1939. Then, he improved
# this computer in 1941 and called it the Z3. These machines perform a single elementary operation
# in milliseconds. They are much faster than tabulators. This performance gain happens due to the use
# of relays instead of rotating cylinders.

# The increased computation speed is the first feature of Zuse’s computers. The second feature is the
# concept of a computer program, which is a sequence of instructions interpreted by a computer. This was
# arguably the first universal machine—a computational device that follows an algorithm chosen by the user.

# An algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions to perform a particular calculation or task.

# * MARK: - Z3 inputs
# The Z3 computer uses two input devices, in parallel, to support programs.

# 1. A receiver: This resembles the tabulator’s receiver. It reads the program to execute from the punched cards.
# 2. A keyboard: It allows the user to type input data for the program.

# Computers that can change their algorithms are known as programmable or general-purpose computers.

# The invention of programmable computers was a milestone in the development of computer science. Until
# that moment, machines were only able to perform highly specialized tasks. The construction of these machines
# was too expensive and unprofitable. This was one reason why commercial investors did not support projects to
# design new computers. Only governments invested money in them. However, this situation changed when
# programmable computers came along.
