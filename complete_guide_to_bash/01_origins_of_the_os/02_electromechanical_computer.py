# Electromechanical Computer
# Learn what electromechanical computers are and how they work.

# Let’s turn to history to discover the origins of operating systems. The first commercial OS was the GM-NAA I/O.
# It appeared for the IBM 704 computer in 1956. All computers before then worked without any OS because they
# didn’t have the high computational speed that requires an OS.

# * MARK: - Tabulators
# Let’s consider the first electromechanical computer. Herman Hollerith constructed it in 1890 and called it
# the tabulator. The tabulator does not require an OS and a program, in the modern sense. It only performs a
# limited set of arithmetic operations, and its hardware design defines them.

# The tabulator loads input data for computation from punched cards. These cards look like sheets of thick paper
# with holes punched in them. It works in the following steps:

# 1. A human operator prepares punched cards and manually stacks them in special receivers.
# 2. The operator threads the cards on the needles in the receivers.
# 3. A short circuit occurs in each punched hole. Each short circuit increases the mechanical counter, which is a
#   rotating cylinder.
# 4. The tabulator displays calculation results on dials that resemble watches.

# * MARK: - Why tabulators work slowly
# By modern standards, the tabulator works very slowly. There are two reasons for this:

# 1. It requires a lot of manual work for service. At the start, we need to prepare the input data. There is no way
#   to punch the cards automatically. Then, we manually load the punched cards into the receivers. Both these
#   operations require significant effort and time.

# 2. The tabulator uses mechanical parts for computations. These parts are the needles to read data, rotating
#   cylinders as counters, and dials to output the result. All these mechanics work slowly. It takes about one
#   second to perform one elementary operation. No automation can accelerate it.

# If we look at how the tabulator works, we find no place for an OS in it. The OS just does not have any
# tasks to do on such a computer.
