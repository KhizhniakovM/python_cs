# Electrical Computers
# Learn how ENIAC works, and what transistors are.

# * MARK: - ENIAC
# The next step in computer design was the construction of the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC).
# It was the first electronic and general-purpose digital computer that could be programmed.

# The ENIAC was constructed in 1946 by John Eckert and John Mauchly. It used a new type of element to
# perform computations: vacuum tubes. Most computer engineers were skeptical about vacuum tubes before this
# new invention, due to their high failure rate and energy consumption.

# The vacuum tube replaced the relay. The tube is a purely electronic device. It does not have any mechanical
# components as the relay does. Therefore, when the electrical signal comes, the tube’s reaction time is much
# faster than the relay’s.

# Vacuum tubes considerably increased the ENIAC’s performance compared to relay-based machines. The new computer
# was able to perform a single elementary operation in 200 microseconds, instead of 200 milliseconds.

# Since the ENIAC is a programmable computer, we can set its algorithm through a combination of switches and
# jumpers on the control panels. This task requires considerable time and the simultaneous work of several
# people. The figure below shows one of the panels that programs the ENIAC.

# The ENIAC uses punched cards to read input data and to output results. This is the same approach that
# previous models of computers used. The new feature of ENIAC was to store intermediate results on the cards.

# When the ENIAC calculates a complex task, it may lack enough computation resources to finish all calculations
# at once. However, we can split the task into several subtasks. Then, the computer can solve each subtask
# separately. Storing the intermediate results on the cards helps us move data from one subtask to another
# while we reprogram the computer.

# Using the ENIAC gave a new experience to engineers. It showed that all mechanical operations limit a
# computer’s performance. The following are the mechanical operations in the ENIAC:

# - Manual reprogramming with switches and jumpers
# - Reading and punching the cards

# Each of these operations takes a significant amount of time. Therefore, it is ineffective to solve practical
# tasks with the ENIAC. The computer itself had an unprecedented performance at that time. However, it was
# idle most of the time and waited to receive input data or be reprogrammed. These findings initiated the
# development of new devices for both data input and output.

# * MARK: - Transistors
# The next step in computer design was to replace vacuum tubes with transistors. This again increased the
# computational speed by many degrees. Transistors came together with new input and output devices. It
# allowed us to increase the computational load of the computers and reprogram them more often.

# When the epoch of transistors started, the use of computers spread beyond government and military projects.
# Banks and corporations began to use them, too. This significantly increased the number and variety of
# programs that could run on computers.
