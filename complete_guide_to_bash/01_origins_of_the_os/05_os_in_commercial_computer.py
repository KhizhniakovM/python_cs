# OS in Commercial Computers
# Learn what new requirements were introduced as computers were commercialized, and why the OS became a necessity.

# * MARK: - Commercial usage of computers
# The commercial usage of computers brought new requirements, one of which is executing programs one after
# another without any delays. Otherwise, why spend the money on it?

# New commercial requirements needed new solutions. The most time-consuming task was to switch between programs.
# Therefore, engineers of General Motors and North American Aviation came up with an idea to automate this.
# They created the first commercial operating system, GM-NAA I/O. The primary goal of the system was to manage
# the execution of programs.

# The heavy load of computers and the variety of their programs brought another new task. When the computer
# loads a program, the program defines the hardware’s available features. For example, we can only use a
# program if it includes a code to control an output device. Otherwise, the device is unavailable.

# Let’s suppose that we are an organization. We use a particular computer model all the time, and its hardware
# always stays the same. Therefore, we do not change the code that controls our hardware. We just copy the code
# from one program to another, and it takes extra effort.

# Copying hardware-specific code gave engineers the idea of a special service program. The service program
# loads together with the user’s application and provides hardware support. Soon, these service programs
# became part of the first-generation operating systems.

# * MARK: - Why the OS is required?
# Now, it is time to come back to the question: Why do we need an OS? We found out that applications could
# work without them, in general. In fact, such applications are still in use today. For example, utilities
# for memory checks and disk partitioning, antiviruses, and recovery tools.

# The applications that work without an OS are called bare-metal software. Developing such software takes
# a lot of time and effort. The software should include the code to support all the required hardware.

# However, the OS usually provides the code for the supporting hardware. Why would we not use it? Most modern
# developers choose to because it reduces the amount of work and speeds up the release of the applications.

# However, a modern OS is a vastly complex system. It provides a lot more features than just hardware support.
