# Pair with Target Sum (easy)

# * MARK: - Problem statement
# Given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.

# Write a function to return the indices of the two numbers (i.e. the pair) such that they add up to the given target.

# * MARK: - Example 1
# Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], target=6
# Output: [1, 3]
# Explanation: The numbers at index 1 and 3 add up to 6: 2 + 4 = 6

# * MARK: - Example 2
# Input: [2, 5, 9, 11], target=11
# Output: [0, 2]
# Explanation: The numbers at index 0 and 2 add up to 11: 2 + 9 = 11

# * MARK: - Solution
# Since the given array is sorted, a brute-force solution could be to iterate through the array,
# taking one number at a time and searching for the second number through Binary Search.
# The time complexity of this algorithm will be O(N*logN). Can we do better than this?

# We can follow the Two Pointers approach.
# We will start with one pointer pointing to the beginning of the array and another pointing at the end.
# At every step, we will see if the numbers pointed by the two pointers add up to the target sum.
# If they do, we have found our pair; otherwise, we will do one of two things:

# If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the two pointers is greater than the target sum,
# this means that we need a pair with a smaller sum. So, to try more pairs, we can decrement the end-pointer.
# If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the two pointers is smaller than the target sum,
# this means that we need a pair with a larger sum. So, to try more pairs, we can increment the start-pointer.

# Here is the visual representation of this algorithm for Example-1:

def pair_with_targetsum(arr, target_sum):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while(left < right):
        current_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
        if current_sum == target_sum:
            return [left, right]

        if target_sum > current_sum:
            left += 1  # we need a pair with a bigger sum
        else:
            right -= 1  # we need a pair with a smaller sum
    return [-1, -1]


def main():
    print(pair_with_targetsum([1, 2, 3, 4, 6], 6))
    print(pair_with_targetsum([2, 5, 9, 11], 11))

# * MARK: - Time Complexity
# The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of elements in the given array.

# * MARK: - Space Complexity
# The algorithm runs in constant space O(1)

# * MARK: - Alternate Approach
# Instead of using a two-pointer or a binary search approach, we can utilize a HashTable to search for the required pair.
# We can iterate through the array one number at a time.
# Let’s say during our iteration we are at number ‘X’, so we need to find ‘Y’ such that “X + Y == Target”.
# We will do two things here:

# 1. Search for ‘Y’ (which is equivalent to “Target - X”) in the HashTable.
#    If it is there, we have found the required pair.
# 2. Otherwise, insert “X” in the HashTable, so that we can search it for the later numbers.
# Here is what our algorithm will look like:


def pair_with_targetsum_alternate(arr, target_sum):
    nums = {}  # to store numbers and their indices
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        if target_sum - num in nums:
            return [nums[target_sum - num], i]
        else:
            nums[arr[i]] = i
    return [-1, -1]

# * MARK: - Time Complexity
# The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of elements in the given array.

# * MARK: - Space Complexity
# The space complexity will also be O(N), as, in the worst case, we will be pushing ‘N’ numbers in the HashTable.
