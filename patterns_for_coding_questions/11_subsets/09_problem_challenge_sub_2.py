# Problem Challenge 2
# Structurally Unique Binary Search Trees (hard)

# * MARK: - Problem statement
# Given a number ‘n’, write a function to return all structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BST)
# that can store values 1 to ‘n’?

# * MARK: - Example 1
# Input: 2
# Output: List containing root nodes of all structurally unique BSTs.
# Explanation: Here are the 2 structurally unique BSTs storing all numbers from 1 to 2:

# * MARK: - Example 2
# Input: 3
# Output: List containing root nodes of all structurally unique BSTs.
# Explanation: Here are the 5 structurally unique BSTs storing all numbers from 1 to 3:

# * MARK: - Solution
# This problem follows the Subsets pattern and is quite similar to Evaluate Expression.
# Following a similar approach, we can iterate from 1 to ‘n’ and consider each number as the root of a tree.
# All smaller numbers will make up the left sub-tree and bigger numbers will make up the right sub-tree.
# We will make recursive calls for the left and right sub-trees


class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None


def find_unique_trees(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    return findUnique_trees_recursive(1, n)


def findUnique_trees_recursive(start, end):
    result = []
    # base condition, return 'None' for an empty sub-tree
    # consider n = 1, in this case we will have start = end = 1, this means we should have only one tree
    # we will have two recursive calls, findUniqueTreesRecursive(1, 0) & (2, 1)
    # both of these should return 'None' for the left and the right child
    if start > end:
        result.append(None)
        return result

    for i in range(start, end+1):
        # making 'i' the root of the tree
        leftSubtrees = findUnique_trees_recursive(start, i - 1)
        rightSubtrees = findUnique_trees_recursive(i + 1, end)
        for leftTree in leftSubtrees:
            for rightTree in rightSubtrees:
                root = TreeNode(i)
                root.left = leftTree
                root.right = rightTree
                result.append(root)

    return result


def main():
    print("Total trees: " + str(len(find_unique_trees(2))))
    print("Total trees: " + str(len(find_unique_trees(3))))

# * MARK: - Time Complexity
# The time complexity of this algorithm will be exponential and will be similar to Balanced Parentheses.
# Estimated time complexity will be O(n*2^n) but the actual time complexity ( O(4^n/\sqrt{n}) )
# is bounded by the Catalan number and is beyond the scope of a coding interview. See more details here.

# * MARK: - Space Complexity
# The space complexity of this algorithm will also be exponential, estimated at O(2^N)
# though the actual will be O(4^n/\sqrt{n}).

# * MARK: - Memoized version
# Since our algorithm has overlapping subproblems, can we use memoization to improve it?
# We could, but every time we return the result of a subproblem from the cache,
# we have to clone the result list because these trees will be used as the left or right child of a tree.
# This cloning is equivalent to reconstructing the trees, therefore,
# the overall time complexity of the memoized algorithm will also be the same.
